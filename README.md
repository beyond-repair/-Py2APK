# Py2APK: Your Python AI, Now on Android


**Got a killer AI model written in Python?**  Want to share it with the world (or at least, the Android-using world)? Py2APK is your one-stop shop for turning your Python AI dreams into reality on Android.  No more wrestling with complex build processes or learning Java.  Just pure Python-powered Android magic.

## What Py2APK Does (and Why You'll Love It)

Py2APK simplifies the often-painful process of packaging Python projects, especially those with AI magic, into Android Application Packages (APKs).  Think of it as the bridge between your Python wizardry and millions of Android devices.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Takes your Python project:**  Including your AI models, Python code, and any dependencies.
* **Handles the tricky stuff:**  Chaquopy integration, native library compilation (ONNX Runtime, PyTorch, and more!), and secure API key management.
* **Spits out a ready-to-install APK:**  So you can share your AI masterpiece with the world.

## Key Features (aka The Awesome Stuff)

* **AI Model Execution:** Supports ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, and PyTorch models.  Because your AI deserves to be seen (and used).
* **Background Processing:**  Keep your app snappy and responsive, even with heavy AI lifting happening in the background.  Think Android Services, but way easier.
* **Secure API Calls:**  Protect your API keys like they're your precious jewels (because they are).  Android Keystore integration makes it easy.
* **Optimized APKs:**  We're talking ProGuard and resource shrinking.  Smaller APKs mean happier users (and faster downloads).
* **Simple Command-Line Interface:**  Just a few commands and you're on your way to Android stardom.  No PhD in Android development required.
* **Clear Configuration:**  A simple YAML file lets you configure everything.  No more digging through cryptic build files.

## Installation (It's Easier Than Making Coffee)

```bash
pip install py2apk
Building an APK (From Zero to APK Hero)
Bash

py2apk --project my_ai_app --output dist/
Replace my_ai_app with the path to your Python project and dist/ with your desired output directory.

Example AI Chatbot (Because Examples Are Awesome)
Java

// Java code to initialize and run the AI model (in your Android app)
AIModelRunner.loadModel(context, "gpt2.onnx");
float[] input = {0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f};  // Sample input
float[] output = AIModelRunner.runInference(input);
This Java code snippet shows how to load and run an ONNX model within your Android application, demonstrating the integration between your Python AI model and the Android environment.
